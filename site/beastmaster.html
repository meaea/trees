			<p><h2>BeastMaster64 biography</h2></p>
			<p>BeastMaster64 is a character first introduced in the PewDiePie video "POKEMON GO | GOING TOO FAR?". He claims to be the
			greatest Pokémon hunter alive.</p>
			<p>In his first few appearances, he is documented by Brad, who tries to convince him that Pokémon are not real, despite
			Beastmaster64's claims that he has caught many of them. Later on, Brad eventually believes in BeastMaster64, even helping
			him in his attempt to catch a Gyarados.</p>
			<p>Many years later, BeastMaster64 ends up searching for sources of liquid and filtering them into water using the Marina
			Straw after the world's supply has run out.</p>
			<p>He later finds his way into PewDiePie's office, where he challenges PewDiePie to a shootout in order to kill him and
			destroy his 50 Million YouTube Award.</p>
