			<p><h2>Birch information</h2></p>
			<p>Birch trees, members of the <i>Betula</i> genus, are deciduous trees widely distributed in temperate and boreal regions.
			Recognized for their distinctive bark, graceful form, and versatile uses, birch trees hold ecological, aesthetic, and cultural
			significance.</p>
			<p>Characterized by peeling bark in various shades, including white, yellow, and silver, birches contribute to the visual
			diversity of forests. Their leaves are typically simple, serrated, and alternate, creating a delicate appearance.</p>
			<p>Birch wood is valuable and used in furniture, flooring, and crafts due to its light color, straight grain, and durability.
			The bark has historical uses in traditional medicine, and birch sap is harvested for its refreshing taste.</p>
			<p>Ecologically, birch trees support biodiversity by providing habitat for various species. They play a role in soil stability
			and nutrient cycling. Culturally, birches are often associated with renewal and are symbolic in folklore and art.</p>
			<p>Common species include the White Birch (Betula pendula), Yellow Birch (Betula alleghaniensis), and River Birch (Betula nigra).
			These trees showcase adaptability and resilience, thriving in diverse environments and enhancing the natural beauty of landscapes.</p>
