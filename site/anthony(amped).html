			<p><h2>Anthony's biography</h2></p>
			<p>Anthony is a no-name character and co-founder of TreesDC. He claims to be an idiot but many people said that it's not
			true, and he just has low self-esteem.</p>
			<p>In present day, Anthony learns JavaScript and already wrote a <a href="https://ampedeth.github.io/genius-project/"> site.</a>
			It is pretty impressive how advanced he becomes day by day, and who knows what kinds of stuff he'll create after a year 
			or so. He is the beginner in this topics and has a lot of internet problems that are obstructing his learning process, 
			but yet he won't stop.</p>
			<p>A lot of people also impressed by his Stardew Valley skills. By that moment, he has more than 100 hours in-game, and 
			this number grows every day. His wife in the game is.. He has no wife. He claims to have her, and even kids, but 
			witnesess said that his schizoprenia is getting much worse over years. Haha. Just joking. Funny, isn't it? No? Fuck...</p>
			<p>From his biography site: <br>
				<i><ul>
					Hi, I'm Anthony, and while learning the DOM I'll be practicing here,<br>
					I don't think this code will be amazing or anything, but it's better than nothing, I hope it works out.<br>
					Maybe in future it will looks like Resume.<br>
				</ul></i>
			</p>
			<p>From that quote we can easily say that his ambitions are high, he has the spirit to do that and probably gonna make something 
			impressive in the future. Let's hope that he's not gonna die tomorrow because of car accident or something.</p>
