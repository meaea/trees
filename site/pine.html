			<p><h2>Pine information</h2></p>
			<p>A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily
			Pinoideae. World Flora Online, created by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden, accepts 187 species
			names of pines as current, together with more synonyms. The American Conifer Society (ACS) and the Royal Horticultural Society
			accept 121 species. Pines are commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere. Pine may also refer to the lumber derived from pine
			trees; it is one of the more extensively used types of lumber. The pine family is the largest conifer family and there are
			currently 818 named cultivars (or trinomials) recognized by the ACS.[3] It is also a well-known type of Christmas tree.</p>
			<p>Pine trees are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees (or, rarely, shrubs) growing 3–80 metres (10–260 feet) tall, with the
			majority of species reaching 15–45 m (50–150 ft) tall. The smallest are Siberian dwarf pine and Potosi pinyon, and the tallest
			is an 81.8 m (268 ft) tall ponderosa pine located in southern Oregon's Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest.</p>
			<p>Pines are long lived and typically reach ages of 100–1,000 years, some even more. The longest-lived is the Great Basin
			bristlecone pine (P. longaeva). One individual of this species, dubbed "Methuselah", is one of the world's oldest living
			organisms at around 4,800 years old. This tree can be found in the White Mountains of California. An older tree, now cut down,
			was dated at 4,900 years old. It was discovered in a grove beneath Wheeler Peak and it is now known as "Prometheus" after
			the Greek immortal.</p>
			<p>The spiral growth of branches, needles, and cones scales may be arranged in Fibonacci number ratios. The new spring shoots
			are sometimes called "candles"; they are covered in brown or whitish bud scales and point upward at first, then later turn green
			and spread outward. These "candles" offer foresters a means to evaluate fertility of the soil and vigour of the trees.</p>
