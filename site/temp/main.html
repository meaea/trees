			<p><h2>Datacenter of Trees</h2></p>
			<p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves.
			In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants
			that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas,
			and bamboos are also trees.</p>
			<p>Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently evolved
			a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms
			or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years
			old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in
			the world.</p>
			<p>A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody
			tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded
			by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve
			to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches
			and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing
			the food for the tree's growth and development.</p>
			<p>Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen
			cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead.</p>
			<p>Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
			store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.
			Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for
			construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In much of the world, forests
			are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and
			usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's
			mythologies.</p>
